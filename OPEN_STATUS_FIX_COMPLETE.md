# 🎯 OPEN STATUS DISAPPEARING ISSUE - FIX COMPLETE

**Date:** June 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED  
**Issue:** Tickets disappear from "Open" filter when status is updated to "Open"

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The issue was in the API filtering logic in `ocs-tickets-api/main.py`:

### Problem:
- Frontend forms allowed users to set ticket status to `"open"`
- API filtering logic for "open" filter only included: `['new', 'assigned', 'in_progress']`
- Missing `'open'` status in the filter list caused tickets to disappear

### Code Location:
```python
# BEFORE (buggy):
if status_filter == "open":
    query = query.filter(TechTicket.status.in_(['new', 'assigned', 'in_progress']))

# AFTER (fixed):
if status_filter == "open":
    query = query.filter(TechTicket.status.in_(['new', 'open', 'assigned', 'in_progress']))
```

## ✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED

### Changes Made:
1. **Tech Tickets Filter:** Added `'open'` to the status list in tech tickets filtering logic (line 79)
2. **Maintenance Tickets Filter:** Added `'open'` to the status list in maintenance tickets filtering logic (line 555)
3. **Container Rebuild:** Force rebuilt the Docker container to apply changes

### Files Modified:
- `ocs-tickets-api/main.py` - Updated both tech and maintenance ticket filtering logic

## 🧪 VERIFICATION RESULTS

### Test Case 1: Tech Tickets
- ✅ Created test ticket #84
- ✅ Updated status to "open"
- ✅ **SUCCESS:** Ticket #84 found in open filter with status: open

### Test Case 2: Maintenance Tickets  
- ✅ Created test ticket #11
- ✅ Updated status to "open"
- ✅ **SUCCESS:** Maintenance ticket #11 found in open filter with status: open

### Before vs After:
- **Before Fix:** Tickets with "open" status disappeared from "Open" tab
- **After Fix:** Tickets with "open" status appear correctly in "Open" tab

## 🎉 STATUS: COMPLETE

The issue where tickets disappeared after updating their status to "Open" has been **completely resolved**:

2. ✅ **Fix implemented:** Added "open" to both tech and maintenance ticket filters  
3. ✅ **Testing completed:** Both ticket types verified working correctly
