## üè´ Building and Administrator Detection

### **Database Schema Extensions**

```sql
-- User model extensions
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN employee_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN is_building_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN is_district_level BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN building_assignment VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN supervisor_email VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN extension_attribute_10 VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN office_location VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN azure_groups JSONB,
ADD COLUMN last_sync TIMESTAMP;

-- Organizational hierarchy table
CREATE TABLE organizational_hierarchy (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    employee_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    supervisor_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    supervisor_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(255),
    is_direct_report BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    building VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Building supervisors view
CREATE VIEW building_supervisors AS
SELECT u.id, u.display_name, u.email, u.building_assignment
FROM users u
WHERE u.is_building_admin = TRUE;
```

### **Building vs. District Assignment**
The system uses Azure AD properties to determine if a user is assigned to a specific building or serves at the district level:

- **Office Location Attribute**: Contains the school name or "Assigned To District"
  - Example: "East Elementary" assigns user to that specific building
  - Example: "Assigned To District" marks user as district-level staff
  - If empty, defaults to district-level assignment

### **Administrator Detection Logic**
Administrators are identified by:

- **Extension Attribute 10**: Used to identify administrators:
  - Contains "Admin Principal" for building administrators
  - Contains "Director of Schools" for the district superintendent
  - Always used in combination with Office Location to determine assignment level

### **Organization Hierarchy Construction**
The system creates a supervisor-employee relationship tree based on:

- **Building administrators**: Automatically assigned as supervisors for staff in their building
- **Department directors**: Assigned as supervisors for their department members
- **Director of Schools**: Top-level supervisor for all district administrators
- **Technology Department**: Special case with direct reporting to Director of Schools

### **Administrator Classification Examples**

| Name | Job Title | Office Location | Extension Attribute 10 | Classification |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Jane Smith | Principal | East Elementary | Admin Principal | Building Administrator |
| John Davis | Assistant Principal | West High School | Admin Principal | Building Administrator |
| Robert Jones | Technology Director | Assigned To District | (empty) | District Administrator |
| Susan Miller | Teacher | East Elementary | (empty) | Building Staff |
| Mark Wilson | Superintendent | Assigned To District | Director of Schools | Director of Schools |

## üîÑ Integration with Requisition Approval Workflow

The user import system provides critical organizational hierarchy data for the requisition approval workflow:

### **Supervisor Determination**
- Building administrators automatically become supervisors for staff in their building
- Department directors become supervisors for their department staff
- Director of Schools is the supervisor for all district-level administrators

### **Approval Chain Construction**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Staff Member] --> B[Building Administrator]
    B --> C[Finance Director]
    C --> D[Director of Schools]
    D --> E[PO Entry]
    F[District Administrator] --> C
```

### **Special Cases**
- **Building Administrator Requisitions**: Auto-approve supervisor stage
- **Technology Department**: Special routing through Technology Director
- **Finance Staff**: Normal routing despite being in approval chain
- **Director of Schools Requisitions**: Only requires Finance Director approval

### **Data Dependencies**
- User's `is_building_admin` flag affects approval routing
- User's `is_district_level` flag determines initial approval stage
- User's `building_assignment` determines their supervisor
- Azure AD group memberships determine approval authority

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Risks

**Potential Issues**:
1. üö® **Rate Limiting**: Microsoft Graph API has request limits
2. üîí **Permission Changes**: Azure AD permission model changes
3. üìù **Large Directory**: Performance with thousands of users
4. üîç **Sync Failures**: Handling interrupted syncs
5. üîÑ **Consistency**: Ensuring database/Azure AD consistency
6. üè´ **Incorrect Building Assignment**: Users assigned to wrong supervisors
7. üë• **Administrator Detection Failures**: Missing extensionAttribute10 values

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. ‚úÖ Implement exponential backoff for API requests
2. ‚úÖ Regular review of Microsoft Graph API changes
3. ‚úÖ Pagination and batch processing optimization
4. ‚úÖ Transaction management and checkpointing
5. ‚úÖ Periodic full reconciliation syncs
6. ‚úÖ Manual override capabilities for building assignments
7. ‚úÖ Validation reports for administrator detection

<p align="center" style="color: #6a1b9a;">
<b>Implementation Priority</b><br>
User import functionality should be considered a <b>CRITICAL</b> component<br>
required before production deployment of the OCS Tracker system.
</p>

## üîë Key Recommendations

1. **Implement Early**: The user import system should be one of the first components developed, as it provides the foundation for authentication and requisition approval workflows.

2. **Azure AD Configuration**: Work with IT administrators to ensure:
   - All users have correct officeLocation values
   - Building administrators have extensionAttribute10 properly set
   - Appropriate Azure AD groups are established

3. **Validation Process**: Create a validation dashboard that:
   - Shows building administrator detection results
   - Highlights missing or incorrect hierarchy information
   - Provides summary of role assignments
   - Allows manual overrides when needed

4. **Data Cleanup**: Before implementation:
   - Audit existing Azure AD user attributes
   - Standardize building names in officeLocation
   - Create a naming convention for extensionAttribute10
   - Document the organizational hierarchy

5. **Integration Timeline**: Schedule implementation to align with:
   - Authentication system development
   - Requisition approval workflow creation
   - Beginning of academic year (if possible)
