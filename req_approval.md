### **Current Status: DESIGN PHASE**
- ‚ùå Approval workflow not yet implemented
- ‚ùå Manual approval process currently in use
- ‚úÖ Integration points identified with authentication system
- ‚úÖ Database schema designed for workflow tracking
- ‚úÖ Ready for implementation with existing Azure AD groups
