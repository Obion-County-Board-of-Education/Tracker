# Dynamic Role-Based Filtering Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented dynamic, role-based filtering in the OCS portal so that users only see services they have access to based on their GroupRole as determined by Azure AD and the GroupRole database.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ COMPLETED CHANGES

#### 1. Enhanced Authentication Middleware (`auth_middleware.py`)
- **Enhanced `get_current_user`**: Added permission flags for template compatibility
- **New `get_menu_context`**: Async function that generates menu visibility and items based on user permissions
- **Permission-based logic**: Determines what menu items should be visible based on user's GroupRole permissions and access level

#### 2. Updated Main Application (`main.py`)
- **New helper function**: `render_template_with_context(request, template_name, context)` for consistent context injection
- **Updated all routes**: Converted all route handlers to use the new context system
- **Removed legacy functions**: Cleaned up old `get_menu_context_legacy` and `render_template` functions
- **Consistent menu filtering**: All routes now provide role-based menu visibility

#### 3. Updated User/Building Routes (`user_building_routes.py`)
- **Function signature updates**: Updated all template calls to use new `render_template_with_context` signature
- **Consistent context**: All admin routes now use the same role-based filtering system

#### 4. Role-Based Access Rules
The system now enforces these access rules:

**Staff Users (e.g., alewis@ocboe.com)**:
- ✅ Tickets (Technology & Maintenance)
- ✅ Purchasing (Requisitions)
- ❌ Inventory (hidden)
- ❌ Forms (hidden)
- ❌ Management tools (hidden)
- ❌ Admin functions (hidden)

**Admin Users**:
- ✅ All services visible
- ✅ Management tools
- ✅ Admin functions

**Student Users**:
- ❌ All services hidden (read-only access to dashboard)

**Super Admin Users**:
- ✅ All services and functions visible

### 🎯 KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

#### Dynamic Menu Visibility
```python
menu_visibility = {
    'tickets': permissions.get('tickets_access', 'none') != 'none',
    'purchasing': permissions.get('purchasing_access', 'none') != 'none',
    'inventory': permissions.get('inventory_access', 'none') != 'none' and access_level in ['admin', 'super_admin'],
    'forms': permissions.get('forms_access', 'none') != 'none' and access_level in ['admin', 'super_admin'],
    'manage': access_level in ['admin', 'super_admin'],
    'admin': access_level in ['admin', 'super_admin']
}
```

#### Consistent Context Injection
All route handlers now use:
```python
return await render_template_with_context(request, "template.html", {
    "data": data
})
```

#### Permission-Based Menu Items
The system generates dynamic menu items with dropdowns based on user permissions.

### 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

#### Files Modified
1. **`c:\Tracker\ocs-portal-py\auth_middleware.py`**
   - Enhanced permission logic
   - Added async `get_menu_context` function
   - User object now includes permission flags

2. **`c:\Tracker\ocs-portal-py\main.py`**
   - Added `render_template_with_context` helper
   - Updated all route handlers
   - Removed legacy functions
   - Updated imports for user_building_routes

3. **`c:\Tracker\ocs-portal-py\user_building_routes.py`**
   - Updated function signatures for all template calls
   - Fixed indentation issues
   - Now uses consistent context system

#### Template Integration
- Templates already use `menu_visibility` from `base.html`
- No template changes required - existing templates work with new context
- All conditional UI elements respect the new permission system

### ✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETED

#### Logic Testing
- All role-based filtering rules tested and verified
- Staff users correctly see only Tickets + Purchasing
- Admin users see all services
- Student users see no services
- Access level requirements for Inventory/Forms enforced

#### Code Quality
- No syntax errors in any modified files
- All imports resolve correctly
- Function signatures consistent throughout

### 🚀 READY FOR TESTING

The implementation is complete and ready for testing with actual authenticated users:

1. **Test with alewis@ocboe.com** (staff role):
   - Should see only OCS Tickets and OCS Purchasing in navigation
   - Should not see Inventory, Forms, Management, or Admin options

2. **Test with admin users**:
   - Should see all service options

3. **Verify template rendering**:
   - Navigation properly shows/hides based on permissions
   - Dashboard displays appropriate service cards

### 📋 POST-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

- [x] ✅ Role-based filtering logic implemented
- [x] ✅ All route handlers updated
- [x] ✅ Legacy functions removed
- [x] ✅ User building routes updated
- [x] ✅ Logic verification completed
- [x] ✅ Syntax validation passed
- [ ] 🎯 Test with authenticated users
- [ ] 🎯 Verify UI behavior in browser
- [ ] 🎯 Test protected route access
- [ ] 🎯 Audit all templates for consistency

## Usage

Users will now automatically see only the services they have access to based on their Azure AD group roles. The system dynamically filters:

- **Navigation menus** - Only show accessible services
- **Dashboard service cards** - Only display available services  
- **Quick actions** - Only show permitted actions
- **Admin functions** - Only visible to admin+ users

The implementation ensures that **alewis@ocboe.com** (staff role) will only see OCS Tickets and OCS Purchasing, exactly as requested.
