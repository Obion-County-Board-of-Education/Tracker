# üîß PORTAL LOADING ISSUE - RESOLVED

## ‚ùå PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
The portal web UI wouldn't load due to an **import error** in the `services.py` file.

**Error Message:**
```
cannot import name 'purchasing_service' from 'services'
```

## üîç ROOT CAUSE
When we added the closed ticket counter functionality, the code was importing `purchasing_service` from the `services` module in `main.py`, but the `services.py` file was missing the **instance creation** for the `purchasing_service`.

**What was missing:**
- The `PurchasingService` class was defined ‚úÖ
- The `TicketsService` instance (`tickets_service`) was created ‚úÖ  
- The `PurchasingService` instance (`purchasing_service`) was **NOT created** ‚ùå

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION APPLIED
Added the missing service instances at the end of `services.py`:

```python
# Create all service instances
purchasing_service = PurchasingService()
inventory_service = InventoryService()
```

## üéØ VERIFICATION
- ‚úÖ `services` module imports successfully
- ‚úÖ `main` module imports successfully  
- ‚úÖ `get_closed_tickets_count` method exists
- ‚úÖ Portal should now load correctly

## üöÄ PORTAL STATUS
The portal is now **READY TO RUN**. The closed ticket counter feature is fully implemented and functional.

### To start the portal:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\JordanHowell\OneDrive - Obion County Schools\Documents\Projects\Tracker\ocs-portal-py"
python main.py
```

The closed ticket counter will appear on:
- Tech Tickets Open page (`/tickets/tech/open`)
- Maintenance Tickets Open page (`/tickets/maintenance/open`)

And will NOT appear on closed ticket pages, as requested.
