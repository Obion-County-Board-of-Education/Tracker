This is a modular Python FastAPI + PostgreSQL project for OCS. Use best practices for modular monorepos, shared SQLAlchemy models, and Docker Compose. All services should use the shared models package for table definitions. Each service has its own database in the same PostgreSQL server. Use PowerShell-compatible commands for Windows users.
