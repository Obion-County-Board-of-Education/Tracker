# Inventory API Removal - COMPLETED

## Task Summary
Successfully removed the standalone inventory API service and merged its functionality into the manage API. Updated all related code, configuration, and documentation to reflect this architectural change.

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Docker Configuration
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- **Changes**: Removed `ocs-inventory-api` service and its environment variables
- **Result**: No more standalone inventory service in the orchestration

### 2. Portal Service Updates
- **File**: `ocs-portal-py/main.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed `INVENTORY_API_URL` environment variable
  - Updated all inventory routes to redirect to manage API
  - Updated dashboard menu logic to show "Management & Inventory" for users with either `manage_access` or `inventory_access`

### 3. Menu System Consolidation
- **File**: `ocs-portal-py/auth_middleware.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed separate inventory menu visibility logic
  - Merged inventory menu items into "Management & Inventory" dropdown
  - Updated menu visibility conditions to include inventory permissions in manage menu

### 4. Template Updates
- **File**: `ocs-portal-py/templates/base.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed separate inventory dropdown menu
  - Created unified "Management & Inventory" dropdown with both management and inventory options

### 5. Service Health Configuration
- **File**: `ocs-portal-py/service_health.py`
- **Changes**: Removed inventory service from health checking configuration

### 6. Manage API Enhancement
- **File**: `ocs-manage/main.py`
- **Status**: Already contained all inventory endpoints with proper permission controls
- **Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for inventory items, checkout/checkin functionality, search, and statistics

### 7. Documentation Updates
- **Files**: `README.md`, `SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `tests/README.md`, `MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `game_plan.md`
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated service descriptions to reflect inventory merger
  - Removed references to standalone inventory API
  - Updated port mappings and service listings

## üéØ Final Architecture

### Services (After Removal)
| Service | Port | Database | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------|---------|
| `ocs-tickets-api` | 8000 | `ocs_tickets` | Ticket management system |
| `ocs-purchasing-api` | 8002 | `ocs_purchasing` | Purchasing and procurement |
| `ocs-portal-py` | 8003 | `ocs_portal` | Admin portal interface |
| `ocs-manage-api` | 8004 | `ocs_manage` | **Management tasks and inventory** |
| `ocs-forms-api` | 8005 | `ocs_forms` | Forms and tracking |

### Menu Structure (After Changes)
- **Tickets** ‚Üí Ticket management functionality
- **Purchasing** ‚Üí Purchase requisitions and procurement
- **Management & Inventory** ‚Üí Combined menu containing:
  - Management functions (for admins)
  - Inventory operations (for users with inventory_access)
- **Forms** ‚Üí Digital forms and submissions
- **Admin** ‚Üí System administration

## üîê Permission Model
- Users with `inventory_access` can see inventory options in the "Management & Inventory" menu
- Users with `manage_access` (admins) can see both management and inventory options
- The manage API enforces proper permissions on all inventory endpoints

## ‚úÖ Verification
- [x] Application builds and starts successfully
- [x] All services are healthy (checked via docker-compose ps)
- [x] Manage API health endpoint responds correctly
- [x] Inventory endpoints in manage API are protected by authentication
- [x] Portal menu displays "Management & Inventory" correctly
- [x] No references to standalone inventory API remain in active code

## üßπ Cleanup Completed
- [x] Removed all `INVENTORY_API_URL` references from active configuration
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect new architecture
- [x] Consolidated menu system to eliminate duplicate inventory access
- [x] Service health checking no longer monitors non-existent inventory service

## üìù Notes
- Backup files (`docker-compose-backup.yml`, `main_backup.py`, etc.) still contain old references but are intentionally preserved for rollback capability
- Shared models in `ocs_shared_models` still contain inventory-related models as they are used by the manage API
- All inventory functionality is now accessible through the manage API with proper permission controls
